# Simulador SISA

The types are self explanatory, just mess around with main ig.

The code is incredibly self documenting (on purpose).

Do note that I did not prepare an IO system, so those instructions will not work (they panic on purpose).
It would be effort for, like, no reason.

# NOTE
It assumes the input is wellformed. Do not feed it instuctions like

`MOVI R5, 0x555`

because it's invalid. If you feed it invalid input, you're gonna get UB (good luck lmao).
